            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Shoshard Price, I"m 22 year old Full-Stack Coding Student with CodeCrew Code School.</p>
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Memphis,TN. In my early days growing up, football, NFL, and gaming were the only thing on my mind as a kid growing. Coding only become a interest after class in during my sophomore year of high school. In that class I learn how deep code can be and started my research into coding and even coded in the robotics club in high school.</p>
            <h2>Cross-Roads</h2>
            <p>During my Senior year of high I knew I wanted to make games but as a designer or a programmer! I pursuesed being a game designer but lacking some creative in a few areas, I took a step back and look at my options again. When Code Crew offer Full-Stack Programmer, I jumped at the opportunity.</p>
            <h2>Code Crew</h2>
            <p>Code Crew out of the gate was the first time I coded since high school. And with learning Full-Stack Programming in such a short period of time can help me in this every changing job marketing I'm shooting for.</p>
